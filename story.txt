    Ellie got in the red car in her driveway. It looked fast. She carefully backed out of the driveway and sped off.
  After speeding along for a while she suddenly stopped as something had appeared in front of her.
    She was very confused as she has never seen anything like it before. It was no bigger than a microwave, in fact
  she might have thought it was a microwave if it wasn't glowing. She checked her rearview mirror and didn't see anyone 
  coming down the road behind her so she got out of her car to investigate. 
    Upon closer inspection it really did turn out to just be a microwave. She thought to herself that this was a weird
  occurance, considering there was no way for the microwave to be powered. She then proceeded to leave that strange
  microwave alone. She's seen all the movies and read all the books, she did not want to mess with that mysterious
  microwave.
