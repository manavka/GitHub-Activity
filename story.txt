    Ellie got in the red car in her driveway. It looked fast. She carefully backed out of the driveway and sped off.
  After speeding along for a while she suddenly stopped as something had appeared in front of her.
    She was very confused as she has never seen anything like it before. It was no bigger than a microwave, in fact
  she might have thought it was a microwave if it wasn't glowing. She checked her rearview mirror and didn't see anyone 
  coming down the road behind her so she got out of her car to investigate.
